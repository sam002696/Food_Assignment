            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Add an array of colors
                to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even
                fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to
                stews and omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.</p> <br>

                <h2>Stuffing Vegetables</h2>
                <p>Who doesn't love stuffing? First, there's our nostalgic attachment to Thanksgiving, but there's so
                    much more to love. Let's be honest: Sticking one delicious thing into another delicious thing is
                    always a good idea. From hand pies to filled pastas to dumplings, to stuffed chops or chicken
                    breasts, we can all get behind stuffing.</p>

                <h2 class="rec-title">Smoky Chicken</h2>
                <p>Enjoy the flavors of a late-summer backyard barbecue on your lunch break. Smoked paprika delivers
                    grill-like flavor to spiced chicken, and creamy potato salad and tangy slaw complete the meal. We
                    toss the undressed coleslaw mix with sugar and salt, let it stand, and rinse it.</p>

                <h2 class="rec-title">Grilled Banana Split</h2>
                <p>This is a fun mashup between banana pudding and a sundae. You could even get the kids involved with
                    this. Grilling the banana adds a little flavor, while charring the vanilla wafers makes for an
                    interesting texture—together, it’s delicious. Banana pudding ice cream pulls everything together, so
                    it’s definitely worth buying. </p>
